# Image_Location-Finder
The Image Location Finder is a simple desktop app that extracts and displays GPS data from an imageâ€™s metadata. Modern cameras and smartphones often embed location info when GPS is enabled, but it may be missing if disabled or stripped during sharing. This tool quickly checks if location data exists and lets you view the exact spot on a map.
